Note: This project uses cookies. 
Chrome has a problem in storing cookies without server.
You can run Chromium with the --enable-file-cookies command line flag to be able to use cookies or
please use IIS or Apache and setup a webserver for this project.
Using browsers such as Firefox and Safari that allows file-based cookie storing would also be good. 
I tested with Firefox and the cookies can be stored with no problem.
